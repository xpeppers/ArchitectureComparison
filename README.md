# An architecture comparison
Trying [this kata](https://github.com/sandromancuso/social_networking_kata) with two different "flavours":

* Clean Architecture
* Vertical Slice Architecture

## NEXT
* an end-to-end test to actually use the app as a real user
* hook a console interface to the app
* implement a fake message store to store and retrive messages

## TODO
* equals on `User` class
* handle messages with their age (aka "timeline")
